👋 Hi, I’m Clément Gerardin — a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in web technologies.

🎓 I started coding 4 years ago as a self-taught developer, then completed the Web Developer diploma at OpenClassrooms, followed by the core curriculum at 42.

💼 I completed a 6-month internship as an Odoo developer at Krafter, where I worked on ERP solutions for various clients, customizing business processes and building efficient backend features.

🚀 I'm currently building a music-centered social network app using Flutter (frontend) and Django (backend). This personal project lets me explore full-stack development, clean architecture, and modern mobile UX.

💡 I'm particularly interested in web and mobile development, APIs, and scalable systems. I love learning new tools and diving into real-world problems.

🔧 Tech I use / like: Python · Django · Flutter · REST APIs · Git · PostgreSQL · JavaScript · Docker · Linux · C (42 legacy projects)

📍 Based in Lyon, France
📫 Let's connect! I'm always open to collaboration or discussing interesting projects.
